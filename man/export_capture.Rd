\usage{
export_capture(
  capture,
  path,
  overwrite = FALSE,
  meta = c("none", "code", "comments")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{capture}{A `code_capture` object.}

\item{path}{The file path to write to.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical; overwrite existing file? (default: FALSE).}

\item{meta}{Character; one of "none", "code", or "comments" (default: "none").}
}
\value{
Invisibly TRUE on success.
}
\description{
Writes the expressions from a `code_capture` object into a script file.
}
\details{
The `meta` argument controls how metadata is handled during export:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"none"}: Metadata is ignored. Only the captured expressions are written.
  \item \code{"comments"}: Metadata is exported as comments (\code{# key: value}) immediately before each associated expression.
  \item \code{"code"}: Metadata is exported as actual \code{meta(...)} function calls immediately before each associated expression.
}

Expressions are exported exactly as captured, without wrapping, indenting, or additional blank lines.
}

\title{Convert a call object to a list}
\usage{
\method{as.list}{callobj}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A call object.}
}
\value{
A list where the first element is the function being called,
  followed by its arguments.
}
\description{
This method defines `as.list()` for objects of class `"call"`, allowing
function call expressions to be treated as lists of their components.
It temporarily removes the `"call"` class before conversion to avoid
dispatch issues and ensure correct coercion.
}

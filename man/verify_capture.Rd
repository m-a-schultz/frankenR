\title{Verify output of a capture against an environment}
\usage{
verify_capture(capture, envir = parent.frame(), details = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{capture}{A `code_capture` object to verify.}

\item{envir}{The environment considered to contain the correct reference values. Defaults to the calling environment.}

\item{details}{Logical; if TRUE, returns a list of mismatches and matches by category. If FALSE, returns a simple TRUE/FALSE.}
}
\value{
Either a logical (TRUE/FALSE) or a list with fields:
\describe{
  \item{matches}{Variables that matched exactly.}
  \item{value_mismatches}{Variables that exist in both but differ in value.}
  \item{missing_in_capture_result}{Variables expected but not produced by the capture.}
  \item{missing_in_reference}{Variables produced by the capture but missing in the reference environment.}
}
}
\description{
Compares the values of assigned variables from a `code_capture` object against those
in a given environment, checking for consistency and reproducibility.
}
\details{
The function re-executes the capture in a copy of the given environment and compares
the results of all variables assigned during the capture. If `details = TRUE`, it returns
a list categorizing matched, mismatched, and missing variables.
}
